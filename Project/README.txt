Have you ever had a genius idea for a movie or dreamt about becoming the next Speilberg, but don’t know if your ideas are good enough? We have. So, we decided, by using the power of machine learning and analysis to create a system that can predict user ratings for a move of your choice.

Machine learning offers a promising solution for predicting the potential success and audience reception of a film. This report delves int the development and implementation of a movie rating predicting system using machine learning, with a focus on leveraging key movie features such as genre, actors and plot.

Through analysis of historical movie data and user ratings, we will explore how different genres, popular actors and plots impact audience ratings. The goal is to create a predictive system that not only provides accurate forecasts of a films potential success but also some insight on how different genres and actors affects the score.

Our vision is to create a system that lets you use your movie expertise to create your own movie. You input details about a hypothetical movie, its genre (action, adventure, horror, etc.), the lead actor you’d want to see in it, the director, and a short summary of the plot. The system should then take these inputs and compare to a large number of already existing movies and their ratings.

Will your movie be a blockbuster or forgotten in the back shelfs of the rental store? Our movie rating predictor will give you a sneak peek into the future!
